## About

I'm an Engineering student that's trying to get into Research while learning and working on backend and GenAI stuff. Amateur badminton player, pro cook (at home) and an avid music lover.

I love to build.

## Experience

### Digital India Corporation, MeitY
**Intern, 2025**
[https://dic.gov.in/](https://dic.gov.in/)

Developed a document-grounded RAG assistant with LangChain, Ollama (Gemma 3), FAISS, and FastAPI, enabling scalable semantic retrieval and inference from internal PDFs.

Designed and implemented a document-grounded Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant using LangChain and Ollama (Gemma 3), leveraging open-source embedding models to vectorize internal PDF content for high-accuracy semantic retrieval.

Built end-to-end preprocessing and chunking pipelines for unstructured data, fine-tuned document retrieval with FAISS, and integrated the system with FastAPI to expose scalable inference endpoints; also documented APIs and conducted functional validation.

### Recallr AI Inc.
**Founding Engineer, 2025**
